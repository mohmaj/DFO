# Dispersive Flies Optimisation
Dispersive Flies Optimisation (DFO) is a minimalist component-stripped swarm optimiser, which solely relies on particles' positions at time t to generate the positions for time t+1 (therefore not using additional vectors, such as PSO's memory and velocity, or DE's mutant and trial vectors).
